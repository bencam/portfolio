# Sources and credits

I took some of the code I used in this project (how to style the titles and the body text on the page and how to add padding above the header) from the two Watch A Front End Engineer Do This videos from the Intro to HTML and CSS Udacity course.
 
I also took some of the code in this project (how to display icon fonts and turn them into links) from the solution code for Project Part 3 of the Responsive Images Udacity course.
 
I used examples from the Responsive Images Udacity course to code the picture elements and the srcset attributes above.
 
Stack Overflow user gilly3 helped me create a more responsive header (lines 17 and 20).
 
And Stack Overfow users HB77 and Ahmad helped me figure out how to force the projects section of my page to switch from three columns to two columns (rather than one) when the viewport reaches Bootstrap's 'sm' size (991px).
 
The artwork displayed on the page is not mine (it is my grandmother's).
